  // ==== Method Overriding ====
  //  If we create our own implementation of run, it will not be taken from the Animal class.
  //  This is called Method Overriding

  // ==== Super keyword ====
  //  When we override a method, we dont want the method of the previous class to go in Vain. We can execute
  //  it using super keyword.

  //  super (a, b) --> call parent constructor
